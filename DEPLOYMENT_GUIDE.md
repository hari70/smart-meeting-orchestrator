# 🚀 Smart Meeting Orchestrator - Production Deployment Guide

## Overview
This guide provides step-by-step instructions for deploying the Smart Meeting Orchestrator to Railway with full production configuration.

## ✅ Current System Status
- **SMS Infrastructure**: ✅ Working (Surge SMS integration)
- **API Endpoints**: ✅ Working (FastAPI with proper health checks)
- **Database Models**: ✅ Working (SQLAlchemy with auto-table creation)
- **Context Preservation**: ✅ Working (Enhanced conversation tracking)
- **LLM Integration**: ✅ Working (Anthropic Claude with fallback)
- **Error Handling**: ✅ Working (Robust fallback responses)

## 🔧 Pre-Deployment Checklist

### 1. Required Environment Variables
```bash
# SMS Service (REQUIRED)
SURGE_SMS_API_KEY=sk_live_your_surge_api_key_here
SURGE_ACCOUNT_ID=acct_your_surge_account_id_here

# LLM Integration (OPTIONAL - has fallback)
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_key_here

# Environment
ENVIRONMENT=production

# Database (Auto-configured by Railway)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:port/database

# Security (OPTIONAL)
ADMIN_API_KEY=your_secure_admin_key_here
```

### 2. File Structure Verification

## 📦 Railway Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Prepare Repository
```bash
# Ensure all files are committed
git add .
git commit -m "Production ready deployment"
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Railway Setup
1. **Connect Repository**:
   - Go to [Railway Dashboard](https://railway.app)
   - Click "New Project" → "Deploy from GitHub repo"
   - Select your repository

2. **Add PostgreSQL Database**:
   - In Railway dashboard, click "Add Service"
   - Select "PostgreSQL"
   - Database will be auto-linked to your app

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables
In Railway dashboard → Settings → Environment:

```bash
# Required for SMS functionality
SURGE_SMS_API_KEY=sk_live_your_surge_api_key_here
SURGE_ACCOUNT_ID=acct_your_surge_account_id_here

# Optional for enhanced LLM (system works without this)
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_key_here

# Production environment
ENVIRONMENT=production

# Optional security
ADMIN_API_KEY=your_secure_random_key_here
```

### Step 4: Configure Surge SMS Webhook
1. **Get Railway URL**: After deployment, note your Railway app URL: `https://your-app.up.railway.app`

2. **Configure Surge Webhook**:
   ```bash
   # Set webhook in Surge dashboard to:
   https://your-app.up.railway.app/webhook/sms
   ```

## 🔍 Deployment Verification

### 1. Health Check
```bash
curl https://your-app.up.railway.app/health
# Expected: {"status": "healthy"}
```

### 2. API Endpoints Test
```bash
# Basic info
curl https://your-app.up.railway.app/
# Expected: {"status": "running", "message": "Smart Meeting Orchestrator"}

# Admin endpoint (if ADMIN_API_KEY is set)
curl -H "X-API-Key: your_admin_key" https://your-app.up.railway.app/admin/family-members
```

### 3. SMS Integration Test
Send a text message to your Surge phone number:
```
Text: "help"
Expected Response: List of available commands

Text: "Schedule meeting tomorrow at 2pm"
Expected Response: Meeting scheduling confirmation
```

## 📊 Monitoring & Maintenance

### 1. Railway Metrics
- Monitor CPU/Memory usage in Railway dashboard
- Check deployment logs for errors
- Review response times and uptime

### 2. Database Management
```bash
# Access Railway PostgreSQL (from Railway dashboard)
# Tables are auto-created on startup:
# - teams
# - team_members  
# - meetings
# - conversations
```

### 3. Log Monitoring
```bash
# View logs in Railway dashboard or via CLI
railway logs --follow
```

## 🔐 Security Configuration

### 1. Admin API Protection
```python
# Admin endpoints require X-API-Key header
headers = {"X-API-Key": "your_admin_key"}
```

### 2. Environment Security
- All sensitive data in environment variables
- No hardcoded credentials in code
- HTTPS encryption via Railway

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **SMS Not Working**:
   - Verify Surge credentials in Railway environment
   - Check webhook URL configuration in Surge dashboard
   - Ensure phone numbers are valid (not test numbers)

2. **Database Errors**:
   - Railway PostgreSQL service is running
   - DATABASE_URL is auto-configured
   - Tables auto-create on startup

3. **LLM Not Responding**:
   - System works without ANTHROPIC_API_KEY (uses fallback)
   - Verify API key if enhanced responses needed

## 📈 Scaling Configuration

### Current Limits:
- **SMS Volume**: Limited by Surge SMS plan
- **Database**: Railway PostgreSQL (auto-scaling)
- **Compute**: Railway's auto-scaling
- **Concurrency**: FastAPI handles concurrent requests

### Scaling Strategy:
1. **Vertical Scaling**: Railway auto-scales resources
2. **Database Optimization**: Add indexes for large datasets
3. **Caching**: Implement Redis for frequent operations
4. **Rate Limiting**: Add request limits for high traffic

## ✅ Production Checklist

- [ ] Repository connected to Railway
- [ ] PostgreSQL database added and connected
- [ ] Environment variables configured
- [ ] Surge SMS webhook pointing to Railway URL
- [ ] Health check endpoint responding
- [ ] SMS sending/receiving tested
- [ ] Admin endpoints secured
- [ ] Monitoring dashboard setup

## 🎯 Next Steps After Deployment

1. **Test with Real Phone Numbers**: Use actual phone numbers for SMS testing
2. **Add Team Members**: Use admin endpoints to add family/team members
3. **Monitor Usage**: Check Railway metrics and logs
4. **Scale as Needed**: Upgrade Railway plan based on usage
