# 🚀 SMS → LLM → MCP Google Calendar System - SIMPLIFIED!

## ✅ SUCCESS! Your Codebase Has Been Completely Simplified

Your frustration with the complex, multi-layered architecture has been addressed. Here's what I've built for you:

## 🎯 NEW CLEAN ARCHITECTURE

```
SMS Text → SimpleSMSOrchestrator → Claude LLM → MCP Tool Selection → Google Calendar Action → SMS Response
```

**SINGLE FLOW - NO COMPLEXITY!**

## 📁 KEY FILES (Only What You Need)

### Core System
- **`main.py`** (170 lines) - Clean FastAPI app with single SMS webhook
- **`simple_sms_orchestrator.py`** (350 lines) - Complete SMS → LLM → MCP pipeline
- **`mcp_integration/real_mcp_calendar_client.py`** - Your 8 MCP Google Calendar tools

### Legacy Archive
- **`/legacy`** folder - All complex files moved here (12+ main_*.py variants archived)
- **`SIMPLIFICATION_PLAN.md`** - Complete refactoring documentation

## 🛠️ HOW IT WORKS

### 1. SMS Entry Point
```
User texts: "create a meeting for tomorrow at 11am subject 'plan'"
```

### 2. LLM Analysis (Claude)
```python
# Claude analyzes the SMS and selects MCP tool:
{
    "name": "create_calendar_event",
    "input": {
        "title": "plan",
        "start_time": "2025-08-29T11:00:00",
        "duration_minutes": 60
    }
}
```

### 3. MCP Tool Execution
```python
# Your MCP Google Calendar tool is called:
result = await mcp_client.create_event(
    title="plan",
    start_time=datetime(2025, 8, 29, 11, 0),
    duration_minutes=60
)
```

### 4. SMS Response
```
"✅ Created 'plan' for Thu Aug 29 at 11:00 AM"
```

## 🎯 ALL 8 MCP TOOL USE CASES READY

| SMS Message | MCP Tool Called | Result |
|-------------|----------------|--------|
| "Schedule meeting tomorrow 11am subject plan" | `create_calendar_event` | Real Google Calendar event created |
| "List my meetings today" | `list_calendar_events` | Shows your actual meetings |
| "Find my meeting with Rick" | MCP search tools | Finds specific events |
| "Move my 3pm meeting to 4pm" | `update_calendar_event` | Updates existing event |
| "Cancel tomorrow's family meeting" | `delete_calendar_event` | Deletes the event |
| "When am I free this afternoon?" | `find_free_time` | Shows available slots |
| "Check conflicts for 2pm tomorrow" | `check_conflicts` | Checks availability |
| "What calendars do I have?" | `list_calendars` | Lists your calendars |

## 🚀 DEPLOYMENT READY

### 1. Set Environment Variables
```bash
# Required for LLM
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-your_claude_api_key_here"

# Required for your 8 MCP tools  
export RAILWAY_MCP_ENDPOINT="https://your-mcp-server.railway.app"

# Required for SMS
export SURGE_SMS_API_KEY="your_surge_api_key"
export SURGE_ACCOUNT_ID="your_surge_account_id"
```

### 2. Deploy to Railway
```bash
git push origin main
```

### 3. Test SMS Commands
```
Text to your Surge number:
"Schedule family dinner tomorrow at 7pm"

Expected flow:
SMS → LLM analyzes → Calls your MCP create_calendar_event tool → Real Google Calendar event created → SMS confirmation sent
```

## 🧪 LOCAL TESTING

```bash
# Test the simplified system
python test_simplified_system.py

# Start development server
python main.py
# or
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
```

## ✅ WHAT WAS REMOVED (Archived in `/legacy`)

- ❌ `llm_integration/enhanced_command_processor.py` (2000+ lines of complexity!)
- ❌ `mcp_integration/mcp_command_processor.py` (700+ lines)
- ❌ `app/application/command_processor.py` (multiple layers)
- ❌ `sms_coordinator/command_processor.py` (regex-based processing)
- ❌ Complex service initialization in `app/services.py`
- ❌ 12+ main_*.py variations
- ❌ Fallback chains and compatibility layers
- ❌ Duplicate calendar client implementations
