# Smart Meeting Orchestrator

SMS-based meeting coordination using MCP (Model Context Protocol) architecture with Surge SMS API.

## 🎯 Overview

Transform your family/team coordination with SMS-powered AI! Text simple commands like "Family meeting about vacation this weekend" and the AI will:
- Find everyone's availability
- Create Google Meet links  
- Send calendar invites
- Coordinate across multiple systems seamlessly

## 🏗️ Architecture

```
Family SMS → Surge SMS → SMS Coordination MCP → Multiple AI Tools → Responses via SMS
```

**MCP Server Stack:**
- **SMS Coordination MCP** - Main hub (routes commands, manages conversations)
- **Google Meet MCP** - Creates meeting links
- **Meeting Intelligence MCP** - Learns patterns, generates smart agendas
- **Google Calendar MCP** - Scheduling and availability (coming soon)
- **Strava MCP** - Fitness context for optimal meeting times (integration ready)

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

1. **Surge SMS Account** (https://surge.app/)
   - Get API key (sk_live_...)
   - Get Account ID (acct_...)

2. **Railway Account** (https://railway.app/)
   - Free tier works for MVP

### Test Your Setup

```bash
cd tests/
python surge_sms_test.py
```

Expected: You receive an SMS on your phone!

### Deploy to Railway

1. **Connect Repository**
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/smart-meeting-orchestrator.git
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial Smart Meeting Orchestrator"
   git push -u origin main
   ```

2. **Railway Setup**
   - Connect your GitHub repo to Railway
   - Add PostgreSQL database
   - Set environment variables:
     ```env
     SURGE_SMS_API_KEY=sk_live_your_key_here
     SURGE_ACCOUNT_ID=acct_your_id_here
     DATABASE_URL=[Auto-generated by Railway]
     ENVIRONMENT=production
     ```

3. **Configure Surge Webhook**
   - Go to https://hq.surge.app/webhooks
   - Add webhook: `https://your-railway-app.up.railway.app/webhook/sms`
   - Enable `message.received` events

## 📱 Usage

## 🛠️ Development

### Local Development
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set environment variables
export SURGE_SMS_API_KEY=sk_live_...
export SURGE_ACCOUNT_ID=acct_...
export DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...

# Run locally (tables auto-create on startup via FastAPI lifespan)
uvicorn main:app --reload

# Admin / Debug Endpoints (protected)
# Include header: X-API-Key: <your_admin_key>
```

### Testing
```bash
# Test Surge SMS integration
python tests/surge_sms_test.py

# Test webhook endpoint
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/webhook/sms \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"event": "message.received", "message": {"body": "test"}}'
```

## 🔒 Security & Compliance

- Phone number verification through Surge
- TCPA compliance for SMS messaging
- Data encryption in transit and at rest
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Webhook signature validation (recommended)

## 💰 Costs

- **Railway**: Free tier (upgrade as needed)
- **Surge SMS**: ~$0.01-0.10 per message
- **PostgreSQL**: Included with Railway
- **Total**: Under $10/month for family use

## 🤝 Contributing

This is a personal family project that demonstrates SMS-MCP architecture patterns. Feel free to fork and adapt for your own use cases!

### Recent Refactor Notes
- Consolidated multiple legacy `main_*.py` entrypoints into a single `main.py` using FastAPI lifespan.
- Added lightweight admin & debug API key protection (header: `X-API-Key`).
- Database portability improvements (custom GUID type, SQLite fallback for tests).
- Initial pytest suite added; expand with webhook & service mocks next.
